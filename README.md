# BatchOS

### UPDATE: Development is currently paused. Development priority has gone to my HQ9+ implementations.
Project BatchOS - pushing Batch to the limit. A mini operating system with functionality.

  BatchOS is a project that aims to create a mini-OS that can run within Windows. 
  This project also aims for compatibility. 
 - That means acceptably working even in XP¹.
   
Right now, the project is in the Alpha development stage. The first beta release is anticipated in 3 months.

Basic programs will also come with it (well, they're just other batch files) in order to enhance the BatchOS experience.

## Features

- DOS-style terminal
- Text-based graphical environment coming soon!
- Compact by design
- Maintains compatibility by using features that work on older Windows systems
- Internet access²


## Editions

-Standard (Development Priority)

-Legacy 

## Other

Caveats:

1 - Some potential incompatibilities
2 - Limited, due to the contexts of this mini-OS
