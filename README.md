# BatchOS

### UPDATE: Project BatchOS will no longer be released in batchfiles. All builds 1200 and older are now deprecated.
### The project won't be renamed for now, but the project has now been transitioned to Python for easier development.

# Project BatchOS - pushing the command line to the limit. Simulated operating system with functionality.

  BatchOS is a project that aims to create a mini-OS that can run within Windows (Mac and Linux soon).
  That means a simulated CLI OS (comparable to DOS) on your preferred command line. All versions with build numbers are to be considered DEPRECATED and will be removed at a later date. They are batchfiles incompatible with any other OS than Windows. Issues raised regarding BatchOS builds 1000, 1100 and 1200 will be ignored.
   
The project has been reset and will transition its versioning from build numbers to version numbers (e.g. v1.0).



There are plans to write some 'programs' for it (a.k.a. other Python scripts) in order to enhance the BatchOS experience.
