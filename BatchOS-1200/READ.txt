This is Alpha Development Build 1200.

A changelog function has been added into BatchOS.
Two new commands. Fully functioning encrypted account system.
More small changes.

Note that due to the account system, BatchOS may not work well
if the host OS does not have PowerShell. This can be a problem for
systems running old operating systems, such as Windows XP. You can
use BatchOS without it, just press N when it prompts you if you
wish to use accounts. PowerShell can be found for download online,
though for systems like XP/Vista, you will be stuck with v1/v2.

Speaking of Windows XP, I've found some minor incompatibilities with
it concerning the setup program. A fix will be implemented soon.

Expect more in the coming days.
